# Guthrat Immobilien
A website for a real estate agent (in German). All of the html elements are created dynamically with Javascript. JS is separated into files and bundled up with webpack before deployment.

## Project/Learning Goals
- create a website for a real estate agent, that is both minimalist + modern but still looks conservative, professional and sets up the real estate agent as someone who you can rely on. 
- use this website to learn Javascript modules and bundling them up with webpack
- improve your DOM manipulation skills by leavin the html files empty and creating all of the content dynamically
- make the design responsive and intuitive
- learn to define a minimum viable product and stick with it (avoid feature creep)

## MVP specification (minimum viable product)
- The website should have:
  1. Top nav bar with contact info and maybe a logo
  1. Home with a bit of a sell pitch + nice photo of the agent, perhaps what people write about the agency and/or its certificates
  1. A menu from which you can access: "Immobilienangebote", "Verkauf", "Kontakt"
  2. Bottom nav bar with "Impressum", "AGB", "Datenschutz" 

## Project Roadmap
- [ ] set up all the directories and config files necessary for webpack
- [ ] create a dummy page and connect a few modules to each other
- [ ] research the MVP for real estate agents and come up with a wireframe
- [ ] create a design for the page in Figma
- [ ] create a static prototype page with multiple html files
- [ ] tweak the css until it matches the design as well as possible
- [ ] plan out/ pseudo code the modules
- [ ] transfer all the html tags into the js files
